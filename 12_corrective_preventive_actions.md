# Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)

CAPA process includes:

- Root cause analysis of non-conformities or incidents.
- Implementation of fixes with tracking tickets.
- Preventive improvements based on trends and audit results.
- Effectiveness verification (e.g., re-test, review).

CAPA records are maintained and reviewed during management reviews.
