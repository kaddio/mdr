# Risk Management

Our risk management process includes:

1. Hazard identification (e.g. data loss, downtime).
2. Risk analysis and evaluation (based on likelihood and severity).
3. Risk control (e.g. backups, security audits).
4. Verification of controls.
5. Residual risk evaluation and benefit-risk analysis.
6. Ongoing risk monitoring via support feedback and incident reports.

Risk assessments are reviewed before every major release.
