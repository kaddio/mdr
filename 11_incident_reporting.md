# Incident Reporting

We define an incident as any unintended malfunction or data breach that could pose a risk.

Process:

1. Any team member may log an incident.
2. Product owner reviews and classifies it.
3. If serious, QMS coordinator evaluates whether it must be reported under MDR.
4. Root cause analysis is performed.
5. Corrective actions are documented and tracked.

Serious incidents are reported to the competent authority within required timeframes.
