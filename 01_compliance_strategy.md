# Compliance Strategy

We ensure compliance with the MDR by:

- Maintaining documented procedures aligned with MDR Article 10.9.
- Performing regular internal audits.
- Tracking regulatory changes and adjusting procedures accordingly.
- Version-controlling all changes to the product and development process.
- Reviewing any product changes through a change management process involving both product owners and developers.
- Maintaining a risk-based approach to updates, with documentation of justifications.

Changes to the system are reviewed for potential impact on safety, performance, or regulatory requirements, and signed off by both a product owner and the QMS coordinator before release.
