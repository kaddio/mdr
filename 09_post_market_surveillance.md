# Post-Market Surveillance

We use the following for ongoing product monitoring:

- User feedback (via support requests and feature suggestions).

These are registered in https://github.com/kaddio/kaddio/issues primarily by the support technicians and are monitored regularly.

- Monitoring of system logs for errors or anomalies.

We use https://my.papertrailapp.com/ to monitor the system logs.

- Monitoring of system performance

We use https://app.montiapm.com/ to monitor the systems performance and react when necessary.

- Monthly internal review of incidents and trends.

- Annual Post-Market Surveillance Report (PMSR), summarizing findings and proposed changes.

Urgent issues trigger immediate review and correction.
