# UDI Management

Though our system is software-only and may not always require UDI, if applicable:

- A UDI is generated and documented for each released version.
- Release artifacts are labeled with the UDI and stored with version-controlled metadata.
- A log of all UDI codes is maintained.

UDI-related procedures align with MDR Articles 27.3 and 29.
