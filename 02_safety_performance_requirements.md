# Identification of Safety and Performance Requirements

We identify and comply with:

- General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) under MDR Annex I.
- Relevant harmonized standards (e.g., ISO 14971 for risk management, IEC 62304 for software lifecycle).
- GDPR and applicable national data privacy regulations.

Each requirement is mapped to specific features or functions, reviewed during planning, and validated through testing.
