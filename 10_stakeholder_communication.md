# Stakeholder Communication

We communicate with:

- Authorities: as required, e.g., in case of reportable incidents.
- Customers: through release notes, news letter mails, the dash board in the system and sometimes by direct communication.
- Internal stakeholders: via weekly meetings and real-time messaging.
