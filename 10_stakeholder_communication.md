# Stakeholder Communication

We communicate with:

- Authorities: as required, e.g., in case of reportable incidents.
- Customers: through release notes, support channels, and quarterly updates.
- Internal stakeholders: via monthly meetings and real-time messaging.

All communication regarding safety, performance, or compliance is documented and traceable.
